# Automotus Prototype

## Requirements / Background

- Parking enforcement officers need a way to improve their current workflow involving radio dispatch & paper lists to quickly identify parking violations and traveling to those violations
- Mobile-first companion app that will
  - Show PEOs the location of parking violations
  - Understand the violation circumstances (e.g. current vehicles, status)
  - Log PEO activity (e.g. visited zone, issued warning)
- Minimum viewport width: `375px`
-

## Metrics of Success

- Identify key MVP features (MoSCoW analysis)
- Implement Must Have MVP features, optionally Should Have
- Design mock API consumed by FE
- Handle real-world UX (e.g. API request states, edge cases)

## Deliverables

- Github repo
  - Setup & Run Instructions
  - Tech Stack Choices & Rationale
  - API Documentation
  - Demo instructions (e.g. how to trigger error states)
- Runnable locally
- Written summary
  - 500-750 words
  - What was prioritized & why?
  - What was cut & why?
  - What assumptions were made about user needs?
  - How did I approach API design? What tradeoffs were made?
  - What would I build with another 2-3 hours?
